### About Me

I am a graduate student with over 2 years of industry experience in AI, and over 2 years of academic research experience in Computer Science.

My passion for programming and applying advanced tech to the real world drove me to change my major from Physics to Computer Science and now pushes me to continue my study and develop my future career in Computer Science & Natural Language Processing in Silicon Valley.

As a future professional in software engineering, I specialize in both front-end and back-end, equipped with knowledge in the area of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. Now, I am looking to utilize my programming skills and make our life better with my effort.
