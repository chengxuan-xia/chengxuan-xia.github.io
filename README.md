### About Me

I am a graduate student in School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research area mainly focuses on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing in financial documents. To me, there is nothing more exciting than applying AI tech to financial domain or other field that can make our life better. 'Dive deep' is the most accurate discription of me.

### Research Experiences
_July 2020 - Present_ **Key Lab of Intelligent Information Processing, CAS**

_Research Assistant | Advisor: Ping Luo, Associate Professor, UCAS_
*	Proposed a novel task on gasping and determining 4 kinds of logical relations among financial texts and expanded the scope of
application of traditional STS tasks. Built a model with 12 embedding layers, bi-LSTM as transformer and combined with a financial KG and context message as external knowledge. It has achieved 0.912 F1.
* Upgraded an algorithm on Named-Entity Recognition task in extracting structured information, after reformed from the pipeline approach to span-based method, the systemâ€™s accuracy was further improved from 0.92 to 0.96
*	Built a GRU RNN based language model to generate a continuation in Chinese (in PyTorch); achieved 22.4 perplexity on a test set of 30k sentences

_Nov 2019 - Jan 2020_ **CCF Big Data & Computing Intelligence Contest**
* Built a machine learning model to solve the Emotional Analysis of Internet News task, achieved 0.817 accuracy and ranked top 2% of all the teams
* The model is primarily based on BERT, with a fine-tuned keywords-to-emotions dictionary to enhance the performance especially when there are multiple entities in the news

### Professional Experiences
_Jul 2020 - Present_   **Beijing Paoding Technology LTD**

Software Development Engineer Intern, Research Department

*	Took full responsibility of designing a system Solitaire to extract and match the values and descriptions pairs from financial
documents, it has achieved 0.953 accuracy on a real-world dataset and has been bought by several securities companies
*	Proposed a weak supervision method to generate about 6 million labeled data with over 95% accuracy, while 10 professionals
need 1 week to label 2000 ones before
*	Developed an algorithm that can automatically transform data into proper format, analyze data within over 60k sentences
*	Constructed a bi-directional LSTM RNN to label and locate information in structured documents (in PyTorch)
_Sep 2020 - Jan 2021_   **UCAS**

### Leadership Activities
_Sep 2019 - Sep 2020_   **Editorial Department, UCAS**   | Production editor
* Led a team of 30 to produce daily publications on the official accounts of UCAS on WeChat (with over 230k followers), including managing writers and other publishing staff, editing content, and approving final layouts

_July 2015_   **Greenway International Teaching Volunteer Program**
* Led volunteers from different nations to instruct English to 40 local students with self-designed syllabus and teaching methods
