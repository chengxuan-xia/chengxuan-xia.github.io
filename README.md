### About Me

I am a graduate student in School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research area mainly focuses on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing in financial documents. To me, there is nothing more exciting than applying AI tech to financial domain or other field that can make our life better. 'Dive deep' is the most accurate discription of me.

### Research Experiences
_July 2020 - Present_ **Key Lab of Intelligent Information Processing, CAS**

_Research Assistant | Advisor: Ping Luo, Associate Professor, UCAS_
*	Built a model with 12 embedding layers, a bi-LSTM as transformer and combined with a financial KG and context message as external knowledge, to extract 4 logical relations in financial texts and expand the scope of application of traditional Semantic Textual Similarity tasks; achieved 0.963 F1 score, the resulting paper, ADTMAN: Accurate Descriptive Term MAtchiNg was submitted to the ACL 2022
* Upgraded an algorithm for a Named-Entity Recognition task that extracted structured information, that improved the systemâ€™s accuracy from 0.92 to 0.96
* Built a GRU RNN based language model to generate a continuation in Chinese (in PyTorch); achieved 22.4 perplexity on a test set of 30,000 sentences

_Nov 2019 - Jan 2020_ **CCF Big Data & Computing Intelligence Contest**
* Built a machine learning model based on BERT to analyze the emotional preference of Internet news, achieved 0.817 accuracy
* Utilized a python framework Scrapy to collect information from news website, built a keywords-to-emotions dictionary, which increased the model performance by 8.6% and finally outperformed 98% of competitors

### Professional Experiences
_Sep 2020 - Present_   **Beijing Paoding Technology LTD**

Software Development Engineer Intern, Research Department

*	Built an application in Python Flask framework to extract and match the value-description pairs from standard financial
documents; implemented Flask API, which was productized with other features and sold to 16 audit firms, averagely reducing
their 30 hours manual work per month
*	Developed a Python library for data processing, extracting information from documents that size over 60k sentences and
producing Excel and JSON strings, these results will be used in downstream APIs
*	Utilized cloud services and deployed weak supervision method on a keyword-based model, generated 6 million high-quality
labeled data, saving 6 months and $20,000 from human annotation
*	Constructed a bi-directional LSTM RNN model to accurately identify and extract elements such as tables, paragraphs, and
pictures in PDF

_Sep 2020 - Jan 2021_   **UCAS** 

Undergraduate Teaching Assistant
